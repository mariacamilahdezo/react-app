# Real Estate Maintenance Module (ReactJS, TailwindCSS, PostCSS, Vite, Redux) CODE CHUNK

## Project Overview
This repository contains the `src` folder of a React project for a real estate maintenance module. It serves as a showcase of my ability to organize a React project, manage state with Redux, and develop functional components. While the code is not fully functional, it highlights the structure, state management, and component-based architecture.

## Tech Stack
- **ReactJS**
- **TailwindCSS** (with PostCSS)
- **Vite** (for bundling and fast development)
- **Redux** (state management, slices, reducers)

## State Management

State is managed using Redux slices and reducers. Each feature has its own slice to handle the corresponding logic, ensuring scalability and modularity. The app is designed to manage complex states efficiently, such as the status of maintenance requests.

## Functional Components
The project emphasizes functional components, each designed for reusability and ease of understanding. Components are connected to the Redux store for state-driven UI updates.

## Notes
This project uses some reusable components from @fuse. However, the inside logic is personal. This is a non-functional project designed to showcase coding practices, folder organization, and state management. Feel free to explore the code and ask.
